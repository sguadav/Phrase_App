1 million on Tumblr
1 million on Instagram.

2 million people in the good vibe tribe!!! (Not including my other blogs and accounts)

4 weeks ago there were 900,000 of us on Instagram and Tumblr, I can't believe how fast #TheGoodVibeTribe is growing. 
In May 2011 I changed the way people read quotes by transforming them into graphics, making quotes visually engaging. Over the years, the audience has grown and I've used this platform to interact with some amazing young poets and writers worldwide and share their words with you all. Shoutout to @rachelwolchin @elusivemetaphors @alex_elle @dauvoire @expherience 
The aim is to help people get through whatever they're going through by creating a space online that continuously pumps out positivity and GoodVibes.

Thank you all, new and old readers for being apart of this, let's continue to spread positivity and good vibes!! TeamðŸ’ª
