On the 28th Feb our second account @thegoodquote.co was hacked. They removed all the content we published over the last two years, including my mothers cancer updates. They also deleted all of the DM's we received from people going through treatment too and other important messages that we received from our audience. They changed the name of the account three times and every time they uploaded a picture, it would receive hundreds of comments from our audience expressing their anger and disappointment. 
On April fools day, our main account was also hacked but we managed to recover both within an hour, thanks to our amazing partner and the security team at Facebook and Instagram. And yes we had two step authentication ðŸ™‚ðŸ™ƒ. We have been creating positive and motivational typographic quotes as well as encouraging the consciousness of well-being and good vibes, since 2011. We have a collective of outstanding writers that create the content you read everyday and we have established many long term friendships with people half way across the globe. Our main aim is to simply create  a safe environment online where people can seek motivation through any emotion that they are experiencing. 
We have dedicated the last 5 years to growing and understanding our audience and we are now the largest quote account on Instagram and we couldn't have done it without any of the amazing people who follow and support us daily. We have so many plans, but we would rather grow organically and continue to create a relationship with our audience first and then create a something amazing that we know would benefit everyone positively.

There is no point in hacking @TheGoodQuote, our audience won't allow it. #TheGoodVibeTribe is too big and too strong. We would like to take this time to thank everyone for your continuous support. Thank you.
