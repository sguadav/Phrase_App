Be mindful. Make a list of everything and everyone that served you positively this decade, what aided your growth, what broadened your horizons, what forced you to step out of your comfort zone, what forced you to change?, and make amendments to the things that brought you stress, pain and discomfort. 2020 is in your hands, you are deserving of peace of mind, love, prosperity, good energy and an abundance of opportunities, recreate that for yourself and change the narrative.
