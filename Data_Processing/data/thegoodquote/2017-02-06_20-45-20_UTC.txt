As mentioned previously, in 2013 I created a project called Fameless. By then, the Tumblr was booming & we were in search for new ways to inspire people as we moved over to Instagram. We wanted to create a space, where millennials can inspire other millennials & began searching for writers & poets within our age group. I found @RachelWolchin in Nov '13, her outlook on life intrigued me & we began speaking. At the same time, my mother was completing her treatment for cancer & I began training with @chakabars who taught me about nutrition, well-being, fitness, history, he also encouraged me to become vegan & had my back during those dark days. Times have changed but I'll always be grateful. Anyway, I explained the vision to @RachelWolchin & she gave me her time & listened. It’s so important to be heard. She f’d with the project & gave me the name “Fameless”. Fameless Definition: a collection of unknown creative individuals who consciously influence the masses. Through her I found @dulceruby @dauvoire @elusivemetaphors @sonyateclai & @sadpoptarts. The project began successfully, their quotes were being published, their awareness was increased & my audience loved their words. However, at the same time, business was heading into unknown waters & obstacles arose, which resulted in the project being neglected, communication became less frequent to the point where I hardly spoke to anyone & Fameless eventually died. I’m so happy that we’ve reached 11.1m people, but it’s not in the direction I wanted. I wanted the content to be organic, I wanted the content to be better, I envisioned more for my audience. We believe in starting how you means to go on & therefore we must immediately rectify this. Fameless became family, bonds were created & a lot of love/support was shared. These people mean a lot to me, it's personal. Therefore, I am starting again. I will continue to find new writers to join our tribe and will continue posting the words from the original members.

Sincerly #TheGood.
