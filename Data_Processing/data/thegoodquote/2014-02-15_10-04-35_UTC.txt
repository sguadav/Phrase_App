Doesn't time fly. This time last year my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer.

She had 6 cycles of chemotherapy and 3 weeks of radio therapy. At the same time my friends dad was diagnosed too. We both caught it early but for the rest of our lives we will have to be vigilant. 
Since its just the two of us, I was extremely frightened, i really haven't imagined life without my mum there, we're so close, she's still young and there's so much more she has to see and future grand children to look after üòêüòÇ Last year I closed my online store and became her full time carer. I managed to make enough money to secretly book tickets for my family to go to the West Indies (home) when my mums treatment was over.

I want to thank everyone who follows my blog thegoodvibe.co for sending my supportive messages throughout 2013. The support was overwhelming and really helped. I want to thank my friends and family for being there and checking up on me. 
It's been a hard year. Chemo is so painful to watch. But i thank Jah so much for giving us the strength to fight. The main thing that kept our spirits high was positivity. Stay positive! We made sure we hugged at least 4 times a day lol twice in the morning and twice at night, we laughed and cried together but remained positive. 
If anyone is going through cancer and wants to talk, drop me an email at kushandwizdom111@hotmail.com ‚úå‚úå
