Going home.. If you guys scroll down to one of my first posts, or for those who have been following us for over a year now, youâ€™ll remember the essay I wrote about flying my mother back home to the West Indies for a rest, after she completed her 6 month treatment for breast cancer. 
So many of you guys left comments, from wishing her the best, to describing your ordeal with either battling or watching a loved one battle the disease. My mum and I sat down and read through them all, mostly in tears, simply because it highlighted how many people are fighting and for the first time we didnâ€™t feel so alone. I fucking hate cancer. I left an email available for those who wanted to talk and so many people wrote in. It was really nice getting to know you all, and this year I will be checking up to see how your 2014 went. 
Well, itâ€™s another year, and weâ€™re back again, but this time celebrating her 60thBirthday. In 2013, I didnâ€™t even think we would make summer, or Christmas, but sheâ€™s celebrating her 2nd birthday now. I saved all year to make this one extra special. Thank you to the Hyatt for putting us in a balcony room on a high floor, the view is exceptional.

If someone was to ask me, what advice would you give after watching someone battle cancer, I would say.. Change your diet, adjust the stress in your life and exercise. Stop eating processed shitty food and eat organic. If it is too expensive, (which is can be for some, for me I stopped drinking so I used the money for food instead) prioritize the things in life so you can afford, as there are no tablets stronger than a healthy diet. Live and enjoy every day and make sure you tell those around you, how much you love them as much as you can. We are all we have.

DM me if you want to talk, my wifi is limited but I'll reply when I can ðŸŒ» #TheGoodVibe #GoodVibes
