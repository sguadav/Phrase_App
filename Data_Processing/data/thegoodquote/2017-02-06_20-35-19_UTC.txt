H I G H E RV I B R A T I O N S .....Do you know how many times I’ve seen 11:11 in the past 3 months? Randomly, but continuously to the point where it began to scare me. And at the same time, changes and shifts constantly occurring in life, manifestations spoken out of jest are happening before my eyes, which is making me recognize the power of speaking shit into existence and on top of that, almost all of life’s distractions are slowly vanishing, which has allowed me to return to living in peace, whilst spending more time creating and reflecting.

The number 1 or 11 has always intrigued me, and when I woke up and saw that @TheGoodQuote had reached 11.1 million followers my heart felt warm. It sounds silly, but that’s the only way I could describe the feeling. I immediately messaged my business partner and we recapped on our journey thus far. This entire brand is run and managed by us, two people. As much as excitement is expected, especially in this climate, where numbers equate to some level of “relevance” or “power” …there’s a huge social responsibility attached to this account, which we take very seriously, so we’ve always remained humble and appreciative. Our emails and DM’s remind us how REAL life can be for some, and honestly, we don’t take that lightly. Hence why we’ve remained anonymous, sticking to our original mission; providing a space online where people can find constant encouragement and peace. We are constantly finding innovative ways to evolve and have so much in store for our community in the following months. I’m not sure if anyone else agrees, but 2016 was such a challenging year. I believe that 2017 will be an exciting and enlightening year for us all. .
