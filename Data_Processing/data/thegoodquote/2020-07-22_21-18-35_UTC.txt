What are your thoughts?
Iâ€™ve noticed that thereâ€™s a huge misconception around love. Many people have been led to believe that its natural to suffer for love, BEFORE experiencing the beauty of it. How did this become normalised? How did something so pure as love cause us to prepare for war before we even step into it? Align with a soul who youâ€™re equally yoked with, and you will experience love in its fullest divinity. Yes, there will be hard times, thatâ€™s natural, two worlds, two hearts are merging here. But what it wonâ€™t be is toxic, it wonâ€™t reduce your heart to shreds, it wonâ€™t deflate your self-esteem or cause you to lose trust in everything. Itâ€™ll simply be another opportunity to learn more about your partner in a way where love is still present.
