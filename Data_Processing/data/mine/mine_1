You don't trust that someone is never going to betray you. You just trust that YOU'LL be able to handle it if they do. That you'll be able to walk away. Stop worrying if you can be able to trust someone. Because that's a pointless energy to worry about. Worry only about yourself. #selflove # selfcare
