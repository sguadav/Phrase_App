Dre talks about how he’s gone 79 hours of making music with no sleep, how he’s always worked well with Eminem and more.

On working for 79 hours… “I’ve gone seventy-nine hours without sleep, creating. When that flow is going, it’s almost like a high. You don’t want it to stop. You don’t want to go to sleep for fear of missing something.” On working with Eminem… “The race factor was just a minuscule part of what I was doing with Eminem. It was really about the music and how well we worked together. When me and Marshall got in the studio, it instantly clicked.

I put the track on, we had a little bit of idle chitchat, I put on the beat, and maybe five seconds in—I swear to God—he goes, “Hi, my name is.” That was it. And it’s still clicking. There’s something about our thing that’s just magical.
