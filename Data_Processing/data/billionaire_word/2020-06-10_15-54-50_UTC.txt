Are you spending time with winners or with losers?

Maybe that’s a bit extreme – are you hanging out with successful people, people who are more successful than you? Or are you hanging around with people who are equally successful as you? Or are you spending your time with people less successful than you?

Evaluate your five closest friends and come up with an average. Are your friends up, down or sideways from you?

I’d suggest that you spend more time with people who are more successful than you.
