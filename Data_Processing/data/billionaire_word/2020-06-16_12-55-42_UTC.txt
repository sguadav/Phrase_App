In one 2014 interview Musk said that, “I think a lot of things that people learn probably there’s no point in learning them because that they never use them in the future because kids just in school kinda puzzled as to why they’re there.” Inventor and entrepreneur Elon Musk is no fan of the traditional schooling model. Musk is the CEO and CTO of SpaceX, CEO and product architect of Tesla Motors and chairman of Solar City. He is also the founder of SpaceX and a co-founder of PayPal.

In one 2014 interview Musk said that, “I think a lot of things that people learn probably there’s no point in learning them because that they never use them in the future because kids just in school kinda puzzled as to why they’re there.” Musk has revealed in the past that his own experience in public school was horrible, riddled with both bullying and lessons that were neither valuable nor interesting.

Musk doesn’t even care if his employees have college degrees. He told Auto Bild in 2014 that an applicant’s formal education is not a priority for him. “There’s no need even to have a college degree, or even high school really. If someone graduates from a good university that may be an indication that they are capable of great things but that is not necessarily the case,” Musk said.
