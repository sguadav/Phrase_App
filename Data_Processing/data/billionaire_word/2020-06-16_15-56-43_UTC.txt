The Tesla Cybertruck is one of several electric pickups that is expected to start production and deliveries by the end of 2021. But inasmuch as the vehicle is revolutionary thanks to its design, features, and price, it is also meeting a lot of rivals, such as the GMC Hummer EV. But among its competitors, there is arguably no bigger rival to the Cybertruck than the Ford F-150 Electric, the EV version of America’s best-selling automobile. 
The Ford F-150 series is iconic. It has been the United States’ best selling vehicle for years, and for good reason. Its combination of practicality, reliability, and reasonable price makes it ideal for as both a family and utility vehicle. And as challengers such as Tesla and Rivan prepare to enter the pickup market, Ford has hinted at its plans to ensure that its place in the truck market is secure: the F-150 Electric.

Ford has been pretty vague about its release date for the F-150 Electric, though the head of Ford’s Team Edison, Darren Palmer, previously stated that the automaker is looking to release the vehicle “before 2022.” Such a statement suggests that the F-150 Electric was scheduled for a late 2021 release, placing it in direct competition with the Cybertruck, whose Tri-Motor AWD and Dual Motor AWD version are set for release late next year.
