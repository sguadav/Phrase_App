Astronauts have launched to orbit from the United States for the first time in nearly a decade, heralding a thrilling new era of human spaceflight.

At 3.22 P.M. Eastern Time Saturday, May 30, SpaceX’s Crew Dragon spacecraft lifted off on a Falcon 9 rocket from the historic Launch Complex 39-A at Cape Canaveral in Florida – once used to launch astronauts to the Moon, and to launch the Space Shuttle.

however it was the turn of a new breed of spacecraft, a commercial venture funded by NASA. Crew Dragon is the first-ever private human vehicle to head for orbit, the result of years of hard work.

It will now take astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley on board the spacecraft 19 hours to reach their destination, the International Space Station (ISS), 400 kilometres above Earth. Here they will remain for one to four months, before they return home.
