Today’s message with my first cup of the day comes from Warren Buffet: “If you don’t find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.” I know what you are thinking, “That is not very motivational. It is a bit depressing to think about.” The definition for the word “motivate” is, “To provide with an incentive or a reason for doing something.” Many people live life without realising the situation of their finances and the future outlook based on current circumstances. Buffet’s words are a wake-up call to examine one’s condition and allow that to motivate or be the reason to make a change for the better.
